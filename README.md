### Built with BugFender:
As a developer, I know the pain of chasing down bugs, interpreting error messages, and making sense of crashes. That's why I decided to give Bugfender a shot and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.

Bugfender is a powerful logging platform that brings clarity to software errors and logs. I integrated it into my TypeScript project, and while there were a few moments of confusion, Bugfender's documentation got me on track.

The results were astonishing. Bugfender transformed my debugging process with organized logs and easy access. It's like a breath of fresh air, making troubleshooting incredibly efficient.

Speaking of efficiency, I generated around 90,000 logs in a day after integrating Bugfender. Yes, you read that right—90,000 logs in a single day. Bugfender handled this seamlessly, giving me a wealth of data to analyze.

I'm so impressed that I'm considering using Bugfender for issue tracking on GitHub. It's not just about fixing bugs; it's about a smoother development process and a better end product.

To show you, here's an image capturing Bugfender in action. Logs stream in, offering a comprehensive view of my app's inner workings. Bugfender empowers developers to conquer coding complexities.
